# Rigidity in 3D

This project was done during the *Algorithmic Folding* lecture in the WiSe of 2021/22.

You can execute our program using python. It takes a path to a model file (e.g. stl) as its parameter and prints out whether or not its rigid and its possible infinitesimal motions if it is not rigid.

The documentation can be found inside code.

There are also some pretty neat tests that you can run using pytest.
